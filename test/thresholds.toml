# Quality thresholds per skill/artifact type.
# Used by run-skill-test.sh to validate generated artifacts.
#
# Calibrated 2026-02-10 against haiku (N=3 per scenario, 15 total runs).
# Target: 80-90% pass rate on haiku. Sonnet/Opus should pass more reliably.

[handoff]
completeness_template = "handoff"
token_budget = 2000
# Observed: 539-923 tokens (well under budget)

[adr]
completeness_template = "adr"
readability_max_grade = 28.0
# Observed: 24.1-26.0 (F-K grade). Real project ADRs score 21-24.

[design-doc]
completeness_template = "design-doc"
readability_max_grade = 24.0
# Observed: 10.6-20.1 (high variance). Real design doc scores ~11.

[end-user-doc]
readability_max_grade = 12.0
# Observed: 6.5-7.6. Tightened from 16 — Doc Writer persona consistently produces
# accessible prose. 12 catches regressions while leaving headroom.
# No completeness template — structure varies by doc type.

[changelog]
# Artifact-creation-only check. Too short for meaningful readability scoring.
