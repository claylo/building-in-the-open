# Handoff: Phase 4 Complete

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Branch:** main
**State:** Yellow

> All 6 skills written, all 4 personas done, all tests pass (7/7), all quality gates pass (`just lint-docs`). Yellow because the plugin load path hasn't been verified and Phase 5 calibration hasn't started.

## Where things stand

Phases 0-4 are complete. The plugin has all structural pieces in place:
- 6 skills in `skills/*/SKILL.md` (curating-context, writing-adrs, writing-design-docs, writing-end-user-docs, writing-changelogs, editorial-review)
- 4 personas in `personas/` (technical-writer, context-curator, doc-writer, marketing-copywriter)
- 3 templates in `templates/` (adr, design-doc, handoff)
- 6 ADRs with index at `docs/decisions/README.md`
- `bito-lint` CLI with token counting, readability scoring, completeness checking
- Pre-commit hook and justfile recipes for quality gates
- Handoff naming uses `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` for chronological ordering; design docs use `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Decisions made

- Phase 4 commit `8eae3f7`: remaining 3 skills, ADR index, handoff timestamp fix
- Handoff naming changed to HHMMSS granularity (design docs kept at YYYY-MM-DD)
- `curating-context` skill claims `/handoff` invocation name (intentional shadow of superpowers handoff)

## What's next

1. **Verify plugin load path** — confirm Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude-plugin/` structure. The `plugin.json` has metadata only; discovery is convention-based (`skills/*/SKILL.md`). Need to test that an agent session actually picks up the skills.
2. **Phase 5: Calibration** — replace synthetic persona calibration examples with real artifacts from this project. Editorial pass on all committed artifacts.
3. **Consider claylo-rs update** — CI workflow, `deny.toml`, GitHub Actions. The `just deny` recipe exists but has no config file. Clay is updating claylo-rs to resolver 3 separately.

## Landmines

- **No handoff was written after the last session.** The previous handoff (`2026-02-07-initial-plugin-implementation.md`) is from before Phase 4 items 1-2 were completed. This handoff corrects the record.
- **`curating-context` shadows superpowers `handoff` skill.** Its frontmatter says `name: handoff`. Collision if both plugins active.
- **`bito-lint` tokens uses `cl100k_base`, not Claude's tokenizer.** Approximate. See `tokens.rs:8-10`.
- **No `deny.toml`.** `just deny` will fail without it.
- **No CI workflow.** No GitHub Actions yet.
- **Resolver is `"2"` in Cargo.toml.** Clay is updating claylo-rs to resolver 3; match when that lands.
