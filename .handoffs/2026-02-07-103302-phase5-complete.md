# Handoff: Phase 5 Complete

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Branch:** main
**State:** Green

> All tests pass (7/7), `just check` clean, `just lint-docs` all pass (12/12). All phases 0-5 deliverables complete. README written and committed.

## Where things stand

The plugin is functionally complete through Phase 5. All structural pieces are in place and all quality gates pass:
- 6 skills, 4 personas (calibrated with real artifacts), 3 templates, 6 ADRs with index
- `bito-lint` CLI (tokens, readability, completeness), pre-commit hook, justfile recipes
- README written with Marketing Copywriter intro + Doc Writer usage guide (readability: 7.5)
- Editorial pass completed on all Phase 0-4 artifacts: 4 ADR fixes, design doc staleness fixes, pre-commit hook path fix, curating-context structural fix

## Decisions made

- Persona calibration: Technical Writer and Context Curator examples replaced with real project excerpts. Doc Writer and Marketing Copywriter kept (already project-grounded).
- `just check` recipe: removed `doc-test` (no library crates exist yet)
- `.gitignore`: added `.claude/` for local Claude Code config
- `settings.local.json`: cleaned up one-off permission entries, kept only wildcard patterns
- Design doc status updated to "Implemented through Phase 4; Phase 5 calibration in progress"

## What's next

1. **Update design doc status to "Implemented"** — Phase 5 is complete, status should reflect that
2. **claylo-rs update** — CI workflow, `deny.toml`, GitHub Actions. Deferred per Clay's instruction.
3. **Real-world usage calibration** — use the skills on actual project work to validate they produce good artifacts in practice, not just in controlled testing

## Landmines

- **`just doc-test` still exists as a standalone recipe** but errors because there are no library crates. It's removed from `check` but can still be invoked directly. Add a guard or remove it when a library crate is added.
- **`settings.local.json` was cleaned up this session.** If interactive approvals re-accumulate garbage entries, clean them again. The wildcard patterns (`Bash(cargo:*)`, `Bash(just:*)`, etc.) should cover all normal operations.
- **No `deny.toml` yet.** The `just deny` recipe exists but `cargo deny` will fail without a config file.
